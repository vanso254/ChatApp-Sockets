Installation
Navigate to the express-chatapp directory:

bash
Copy code
cd express-chatapp
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Running the Server
Start the server:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
The server will be running at http://localhost:3000.

Backend Code Overview
index.js: Sets up the Express server and Socket.IO.
CORS: Configured to allow requests from http://localhost:5173 (frontend React app).
Socket.IO: Listens for incoming messages and broadcasts them to all connected clients.
Frontend Setup (React)
The frontend is built using React and connects to the Socket.IO server for real-time chat functionality.

Frontend Code Overview
Chat.jsx: React component for the chat interface.
Socket.IO Client: Connects to the server and handles sending and receiving messages.
